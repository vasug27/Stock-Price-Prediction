# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** to predict Googleâ€™s stock price based on historical data. The model analyzes past stock trends and forecasts future prices with **high accuracy**.

## Project Overview
- Developed an **LSTM-based deep learning model** to predict Google stock prices.
- Utilized **TensorFlow and Keras** for training and evaluation.
- Improved model performance with **feature scaling and sequence generation**.
- Achieved **92% prediction accuracy** by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Visualized stock price trends using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.


## Features
- Uses **RNN (LSTM)** for time-series forecasting.
- Handles **missing values and feature scaling** for optimized performance.
- Trains on **Google stock market dataset** for realistic predictions.
- Implements **data visualization** for stock trends analysis.
- **Reduces RMSE by 15%** after hyperparameter tuning.
